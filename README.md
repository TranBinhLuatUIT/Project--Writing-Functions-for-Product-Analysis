# Project: Writing Functions for Product Analysis
A Project from DataCamp and I want to deal with it by myself for study

Here is their description about what should we build:

Have you ever started your data analysis and ended up with repetitive code? 
Our colleague Brenda who works as a Product Analyst, has found herself in this situation and has asked us for some help. 
She's written a script to pull Net Promotor Score (NPS) data from various sources. 
NPS works by asking How likely is it that you would recommend our product to a friend or colleague? with a rating scale of 0 to 10.
Brenda has set up this NPS survey in various ways, including emails and pop-ups on the mobile app and website.
